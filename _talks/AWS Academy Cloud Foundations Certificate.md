## Key Learning Areas

### 1. Introduction to Cloud Computing
I started with the basics, gaining an understanding of cloud computing concepts. I explored the benefits of cloud services and how they compare to traditional IT models.

### 2. AWS Global Infrastructure
I familiarized myself with AWS's global network of data centers. This included understanding regions, availability zones, and edge locations, which are crucial for deploying scalable and resilient applications.

### 3. Core AWS Services
I learned about key AWS services like EC2 (computing), S3 (storage), and RDS/DynamoDB (databases). I now understand how these services interact and how to use them to build scalable, reliable applications.

### 4. Security and Compliance
Security is a major focus in AWS, and I gained insights into AWS's shared responsibility model. I learned about tools like IAM (Identity and Access Management) and encryption methods to help ensure security and compliance in cloud environments.

### 5. Cost Management
Understanding the AWS pricing model and cost management strategies was another key area. I learned how to use AWS tools like Cost Explorer and budgets to manage and optimize cloud spending effectively.

### 6. Architecting on AWS
The course introduced me to best practices for designing and deploying cloud architectures. I learned about the AWS Well-Architected Framework, which helps ensure that cloud solutions are scalable, resilient, and cost-efficient.

### 7. Basic Networking
Networking in the cloud was another crucial topic. I gained an understanding of VPCs (Virtual Private Clouds), subnets, and network security groups, and how to set up and manage network configurations in AWS.

### 8. AWS Support and Pricing
Finally, I learned about the different AWS support plans and how to optimize costs. Managing accounts effectively and understanding AWS's pricing structure are essential skills I developed.
