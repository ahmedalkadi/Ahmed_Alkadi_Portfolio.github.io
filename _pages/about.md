👋 Hi, I'm Ahmed, a Mechanical Engineering graduate from Alexandria University, Egypt. I graduated with excellence, ranking in the top 2% of my class, and have profound experience in mechanical engineering. I've worked as a Mechanical Design Engineer in the field of water solutions and desalination, and I am currently a Teacher Assistant in the department of the engineering Mathematics and Physics, Alexandria university, Egypt. 🎓👨‍🏫

I’m passionate about Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Finite Element Analysis (FEA), renewable energy, and machine learning. 🌱🔧

✈️ I'm an airplane enthusiast and honed my practical skills through my participation as a Mechanical Engineer with the [Lycans Team](https://www.facebook.com/Lycans.Aircraft) for over three seasons in the SAE competition in the USA.

📚 I have a publication in the field of energy storage systems [The Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352152X23002293?via%3Dihub) and have contributed to designing cooling systems for EV batteries. 🚗💡

🎓 I was awarded a fully funded scholarship to study machine learning in a professional manner, providing a comprehensive understanding of AI and its applications. This includes concepts like supervised/unsupervised learning, neural networks, deep learning, and natural language processing.

🤖 I enjoy tackling traditional engineering challenges with the power of AI, blending technology and innovation to find smarter solutions [GitHub pages](https://github.com/ahmedalkadi).

🌍 I am actively seeking a postgraduate position where I can explore new and innovative methods of exploiting renewable energy by utilizing machine learning.
