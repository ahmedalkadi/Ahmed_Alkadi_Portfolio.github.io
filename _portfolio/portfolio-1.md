title: "Electric Vehicle Research"
excerpt: "The present research aims to design the managing cooling system for the battery system, fabricate the cooling system and integrate the (BCS) with the battery pack. The function of this system is to measure the heat dissipated from the batteries in different conditions from discharging, idling charging and fast charging to deliver the corresponding coolant mass flow rate."

Research work objectives:
=====

1- choose the suitable cooling method (bottom plate cooling, micro channels, immersed cooling or corrugated cooling tubes ) <br/>
2- Design mathematical representation of the battery heating .<br/>
3- build the computational domain in ANSYS software.<br/>
4- optimize the bottom plate internal groves to ensure sufficient cooling and uniform battery thermal distribution. <br/>
5- study the effect of adding multi cooling plates to the battery. <br/>


Project Insights:
=====

- It is a national project to have the first steps in manufacturing a locally-made Electric vehicle.
- This project is in cooperation with the (Military technical college) as well as some other engineering schools.
- This project is sponsored by (The Academy of Scientific Research & technology) and the ( Arab organization for industrialization ) with budget 11 million Egyptian pounds around 450K US $.
- The prototype of the electric vehicle is planned to get finalized by June 2023.
