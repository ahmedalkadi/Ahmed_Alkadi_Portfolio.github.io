title: "Electric Vehicle Research"
excerpt: "The present research aims to design the managing cooling system for the battery system, fabricate the cooling system and integrate the (BCS) with the battery pack. The function of this system is to measure the heat dissipated from the batteries in different conditions from discharging, idling charging and fast charging to deliver the corresponding coolant mass flow rate."

<p>
  It is a national project to have the first steps in manufacturing a locally-made Electric vehicle. 
  This project is in cooperation with the Military Technical College and some other engineering schools. 
  Sponsored by The Academy of Scientific Research & Technology and the Arab Organization for Industrialization with a budget of 11 million Egyptian pounds (approximately $450K US). 
  The prototype of the electric vehicle is planned to be finalized by June 2023.

<h2>The Battery Cooling System Design:</h2>
<p>
  The battery cooling system should manage the thermal energy from the battery pack. The refrigeration cycle receives an on/off signal from the temperature sensor on the batteries.

<p>The designed system comprises:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Refrigeration cycle working with R 134a refrigerant with adjustable expansion valves.</li>
  <li>Heat exchangers to transfer battery heat to the refrigeration cycle.</li>
  <li>Circulate pump to circulate the coolant through the batteries.</li>
  <li>Control valve to control the pressure drop from the battery pack.</li>
  <li>Coolant reservoir.</li>
  <li>Measuring instruments.</li>
  <li>Temperature sensors for the circulating coolant (T1 and T2).</li>
  <li>Temperature sensors for battery cells.</li>
  <li>Pressure gauge.</li>
  <li>Flow rate meter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cooling Passages General Arrangements:</h2>
<p>
  The battery bank is divided into 16 modules, each with 350 (14x25) cells (18650).
  The outer dimension of the module is 70cm x 25cm.
  The outer dimension of the battery pack is 203cm x 140cm.
  The required pump pressure is estimated to be 270 pascals with a flow rate around 5 liters/min.

<h2>Simulation Using ANSYS Fluent:</h2>
<h3>Boundary Conditions:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Inlet:</strong> Number of inlet areas is 6 for the side plate. Mass flow is 0.05 kg/s with a temperature of 20°C.</li>
  <li><strong>Outlet:</strong> Number of outlet areas is 6 for the side plate. Pressure outlet, surrounding temperature of 25°C.</li>
  <li><strong>Heat Source:</strong> The battery is subjected to heat generation at a rate of 5 C-rate (57812 W/m³).</li>
  <li><strong>Walls:</strong> All the walls are adiabatic except for the upper wall of the battery, subjected to natural convection with a heat transfer coefficient of 5 W/m²K and a surrounding temperature of 25°C.</li>
