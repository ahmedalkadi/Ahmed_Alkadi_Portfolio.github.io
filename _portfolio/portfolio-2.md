# GitHub Projects:

## Computer Vision Projects:
- [Visual And Textual Product Similarity Recommendation](https://github.com/ahmedalkadi/Visual_And_Textual_Products_Similarity):
  This project recommends products based on their textual and visual similarity using cosine similarity. Visual features are extracted with ResNet-50, textual features with TinyBERT-6L, and images are preprocessed by        removing backgrounds using a UNet model with MobileNetV2 encoder. Features are combined into vectors, stored in a vector database, and used to find and visualize the top similar products.
- [Driver distraction detector] (https://github.com/ahmedalkadi/Visual_And_Textual_Products_Similarity):
  The project aims to identify the types of distracted driver through their facial and body movement like arms and face pose. The project went through many stages of testing to increase the accuracy of the prediction from   using simple NN to use pretrained models.

## Deep fake project.
- [Video Lip-Syncing](https://github.com/ahmedalkadi/Hight_Quality_LipSync):
  The Lip-Syncing project focuses on creating a system that synchronizes lip movements with spoken audio using deep learning techniques. The project involves detecting language and converting audio to text, aligning lips    with the audio using Wav2Lip models, and enhancing video quality after face detection. The system is evaluated using LSE-D and LSE-C metrics, ensuring accurate and realistic lip-sync performance. This project aims to      improve multilingual lip-syncing, especially in Arabic, by fine-tuning the model with region-specific data.

## Natural language Models (NLP) Projects.
- [Arabic Dialect Classifier](https://github.com/ahmedalkadi/Arabic_Dialect_Detector_NLP):
  The project aims to build a model to identify and classify different Arabic dialects from text data, ranges from using traditional ML Algorithms like LR and decision trees to more complex DL approaches such as LSTMs and   hybrid models combining CNNs with LSTMs, to improve accuracy in dialect classification.
- [Arabic POS Detector](https://github.com/ahmedalkadi/Arabic_POS_Detector_NLP):
  The objective of this project is to perform Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging on Arabic text using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Specifically, the Universal POS (UPOS) tags, a standardized set of POS tags that aims to      cover all languages, will be used for tagging. The dataset provided contains labeled data for Arabic text with Part-of-Speech (POS) tags in CoNLL-U format

## Recommender Systems projects.
- [Recommendation_Systems_IMDb_Movies_And_Users_Similarity](https://github.com/ahmedalkadi/Recommendation_Systems_IMDb_Movies_And_Users_Similarity):
  The project involves two models; one for calculating movie similarity based on features. The other recommending movies to users by predicting their ratings. The first model uses cosine similarity, while the second         leverages user-rating history with matrix factorization.
